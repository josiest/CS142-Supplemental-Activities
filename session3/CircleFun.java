/* Method specification
 *
 * Create a static method which takes two points and a radius as an input
 * (you should determine how to represent these inputs). The first point is
 * the center of a circle, and the second point is a point which may or may not
 * be within the circle. The radius is the radius of the circle. Your method
 * should return a boolean value which determines if the second point is inside
 * the circle or not. It should return true if the point is just at the
 * the circle's edge.
 *
 * Testing your method
 *
 * To test your method, you should call it in the main method with three
 * different points: one which is inside the circle, one which is outside the
 * the circle, and one which is at the edge of the circle.
